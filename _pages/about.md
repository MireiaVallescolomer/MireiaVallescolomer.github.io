I am currently an EMBO postdoctoral researcher in [Nicola Segata's Lab](http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/) in CIBIO (University of Trento, Italy). I assess the person-to-person transmission of the human microbiome by large scale strain-level metagenomic profiling. See our latest open-access [publication!](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05620-1)

My background is in Microbiology and Computational Biology (UAB, Spain and VUB, Belgium). During my PhD (Raes Lab, VIB-KU Leuven, Belgium) I researched the microbiota-gut-brain axis, seeking to characterise the microbial production and degradation of neuroactive compounds in metagenomic data, and performing [the first population-level study on the link between the gut microbiome and anxiety and depression](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0337-x) (Valles-Colomer et al, Nat. Microbiology 2019). The study was included in "Nature milestones 2019" as milestone paper in human microbiota research, and was awarded a recommendation from F1000Prime.

Towards the end of my PhD another question became increasingly important to me: how do we acquire such health- and disease-associated bacteria? By strain-level profiling approaches, I currently investigate how human-associated microorganisms are transmitted among individuals and spread in populations.
